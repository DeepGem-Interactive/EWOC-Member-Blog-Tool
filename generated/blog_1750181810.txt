## Introduction  

When we think of estate planning, we often focus on what happens after we pass away. But what about planning for the unexpected while we’re still alive? In this third installment of our celebrity series, we’ll dive into the complexities of incapacity planning through the lens of Jay Leno’s real-life court battle to manage his wife’s affairs amid her struggle with dementia. This isn’t just a celebrity problem; it’s an issue that can affect anyone who hasn’t taken the necessary steps to prepare.  

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach.

## What Exactly Is Incapacity?  

Incapacity isn’t something most of us like to think about, but it’s a critical concept to understand. When someone becomes incapacitated, they lose the ability to make sound decisions—financially, medically, or legally. This can stem from various causes, such as a major accident, a life-limiting illness, or age-related conditions like dementia or Alzheimer’s.  

Unlike death, incapacity is something that happens while you’re alive, and this distinction is crucial. Estate planning often involves separate strategies for incapacity and post-death arrangements. For example:  

- **Incapacity Planning**: Ensures someone you trust can manage your decisions and assets while you’re alive but unable to do so yourself.  
- **Post-Death Planning**: Focuses on distributing your assets and honoring your wishes after your passing.  

If you’re relying on documents like a Power of Attorney, it’s essential to know that these powers end upon the grantor’s death. This means the transition between incapacity and death must be seamless, with a plan that protects what matters most.

## Lessons from the Leno Family  

### Mavis Leno’s Struggle and Jay Leno’s Court Battle  

**So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)**  
Mavis Leno, Jay’s wife of more than 40 years, has dementia and is no longer able to manage her finances. Unfortunately, Jay had to go to court and file a legal case against his own wife to gain authority over her financial affairs. After months of waiting, the court granted him the necessary control, but this delay and public exposure could’ve been avoided with better advance planning.  

### Critical Takeaways from the Case  

Jay’s situation underscores the importance of incapacity planning and reveals several key insights:  

1. **Marriage Doesn’t Guarantee Financial Authority**: Regardless of marital status, assets owned by your spouse remain their separate property unless advance planning grants you access.  
2. **Court Involvement Is Time-Consuming**: Without proper planning, court processes can take months, leaving bills unpaid or causing financial strain on your family.  
3. **Public Exposure**: Legal proceedings often require disclosure of personal information, leaving families vulnerable to scams or other predatory behavior.  

Imagine the additional complications if stepchildren or other relatives were involved—disputes over inheritance can prolong court cases and put assets at risk. This level of conflict can be avoided by putting a plan in place that ensures your wishes are honored.
