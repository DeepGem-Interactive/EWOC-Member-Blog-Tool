For the last two weeks, we’ve discussed celebrities and how they planned (or didn’t!) for their deaths. In this third installment of our four-part celebrity series, we discuss a topic that no one wants to think about as it may seem to be a fate worse than death: incapacity. Unlike death, not everyone will become incapacitated. Yet, it’s an essential part of your future planning because if you do become incapacitated, you want to have made your choices well before that occurs. To illustrate the importance of planning for incapacity, we’ll examine the real-life court case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. I assure you, it is no laughing matter.  

## Why Incapacity Planning Is Essential  

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

Incapacity can strike unexpectedly—whether due to an accident, a severe illness, or age-related conditions like Alzheimer's. What makes this situation even more complex is that incapacity affects you while you are still alive, unlike estate planning, which deals with your wishes after death. A well-thought-out plan includes documents that cover both scenarios, working seamlessly to provide clarity and ease for your family.  

For example, a common misconception is that a Power of Attorney grants indefinite authority. However, this authority ends upon the grantor’s death, leaving families scrambling to gain legal control of assets. This highlights why incapacity and post-death planning must be integrated, ensuring a smooth transition for your loved ones.  

## What Happened in the Leno Family?  

The case of Jay Leno and his wife Mavis underscores the challenges families face when incapacity planning is absent or incomplete. After more than four decades of marriage, Mavis’s dementia left her unable to manage her financial affairs. Jay had to take legal action, essentially filing a lawsuit against his wife, to gain control of her assets. While the court eventually granted him the authority he needed, the process was neither quick nor private.  

Here are some critical lessons we can draw from their experience:  

- **Marriage doesn’t equal automatic authority:** Even as a spouse, Jay had no inherent right to manage Mavis’s finances. Separate assets remain under individual control unless explicitly planned otherwise.  
- **Court involvement is costly and time-consuming:** Without advance planning, gaining control of a loved one’s finances during incapacity can involve lengthy legal battles and significant expenses.  
- **Family dynamics can complicate matters:** While the Lenos’ long-standing marriage likely minimized conflict, blended families or estranged relationships can lead to disputes, dragging out the process further.  
- **Loss of privacy is inevitable:** The Leno family’s financial and personal details became public due to the court proceedings. This exposure isn’t limited to celebrities—it’s the reality for any family navigating the legal system in such cases.  

To avoid these pitfalls, it’s crucial to have a plan that prevents court involvement and maintains your family’s privacy.  

## A Life & Legacy Plan: The Key to Avoiding Court and Conflict  

A well-crafted Life & Legacy Plan addresses the challenges that incapacity creates, ensuring a seamless transition from capacity to incapacity and, eventually, to post-death arrangements. With such a plan, assets become immediately accessible when needed, sparing your family from delays, legal fees, and unnecessary stress.  

When you work with Mo at MoF in Lahore, you’re not just creating a document—you’re establishing a proactive strategy to protect your family. Unlike traditional legal services that often leave plans outdated, Mo ensures your Life & Legacy Plan evolves with you. Regular reviews, at least every three years, keep your plan aligned with your current circumstances, ensuring it works when you most need it.  

This comprehensive approach not only keeps your loved ones out of court but also safeguards your privacy, ensuring your family’s story doesn’t end up as public record. Whether you’re managing a family business, personal accounts, or other assets, a Life & Legacy Plan provides peace of mind that everything will be handled according to your wishes.  

## The Growing Importance of Incapacity Planning  

As dementia and other debilitating conditions become more prevalent, the need for incapacity planning has never been greater. According to Alzheimer’s Disease International, over 55 million people live with dementia globally, with that number expected to rise to 78 million by 2030. Whether due to aging, illness, or unforeseen accidents, incapacity can happen to anyone at any time.  

By creating a Life & Legacy Plan, you’re taking a proactive step to prepare for life’s uncertainties.
