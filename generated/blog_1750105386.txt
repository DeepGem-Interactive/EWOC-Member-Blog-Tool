## Why Planning for Incapacity Is Essential  

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

The Leno case not only underscores how incapacity can disrupt lives but also reveals common misconceptions about financial and legal authority in marriage. Through this example, we’ll explore:  
- The meaning and implications of incapacity  
- Limitations on spousal authority over financial matters  
- The risks of having your private family affairs made public  

Let’s start by understanding what incapacity truly entails.  

## What Does Incapacity Mean?  

Incapacity refers to the loss of the ability to make sound decisions regarding your finances, health, or legal matters. This could stem from an accident, a degenerative illness like Alzheimer’s, or age-related cognitive decline such as dementia. While incapacity can occur unexpectedly at any age, it requires careful planning ahead of time to avoid leaving loved ones burdened with complex legal and financial challenges.  

It’s crucial to recognize that incapacity happens while you’re alive, creating unique planning needs distinct from post-death arrangements. For example:  
- Documents like **Powers of Attorney** only apply while the person granting authority is alive. Once they pass away, those powers end immediately.  
- Separate legal authority must be established for post-death financial matters, often requiring court intervention if assets aren’t in a trust.  

This distinction highlights why incapacity planning and estate planning must work hand-in-hand to create a seamless transition for your loved ones. Unfortunately, Jay Leno’s situation illustrates how failing to plan can lead to unnecessary legal complications.  

## So, What Happened in the Leno Family?  

Mavis Leno, Jay’s wife of over four decades, is battling dementia and can no longer manage her financial affairs. Jay had to file a court case—essentially suing his own wife—to gain authority over her finances. After months of waiting, the court granted him the necessary powers, but not without significant cost in time, money, and emotional strain.  

What lessons can we learn from this?  

- **Marriage doesn’t mean automatic authority over finances:** Even if you’re married, your spouse doesn’t have the right to manage your separate accounts or assets unless you’ve planned for incapacity in advance. Without proper documents, they may need to sue your estate to gain control.  
- **Court involvement is inevitable without a plan:** If incapacity strikes and no planning is in place, court proceedings will be required—regardless of your state of residence or existing Powers of Attorney. This process can take months, leaving your family in limbo.  
- **Privacy risks increase in court cases:** Legal proceedings often require disclosure of sensitive family information, including addresses, financial details, and relationships. This can make your family vulnerable to scams or unwanted attention, as it did for the Leno family.  

Jay and Mavis were fortunate to avoid prolonged legal battles since theirs was a long-standing marriage without additional family complexities. But imagine if stepchildren or other relatives had contested Jay’s authority. Such disputes could drag on for years, increasing costs and risks while leaving assets tied up in court.
