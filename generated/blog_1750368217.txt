Memorial Day brings with it an opportunity to reflect on the concepts of mortality, remembrance, and legacy. But what is a legacy, really? And how does it apply to you? Read more…

Memorial Day not only offers an opportunity to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who gave their lives in service to our country but also provides a moment for deeper reflection. It’s a time to think about the concepts of legacy and remembrance—not just for others but for ourselves as well.  

What does it mean to leave a legacy? For many, the idea of a legacy feels distant or tied solely to wealth and philanthropy. However, this notion couldn’t be further from reality. Legacy is about more than tangible assets. It is intertwined with the stories we share, the values we uphold, and the way we choose to be remembered.  

Understanding What Legacy Truly Is
Legacy, at its core, is about connecting the generations, and Life & Legacy Planning is the way to do it. Here’s an example. Consider a teacher who has spent her career fostering curiosity and resilience in her students. She may not have millions of dollars to give away, but she can use her estate plan to leave her personal library to a local school. She may even set up a small scholarship fund in her estate plan so she can continue supporting education long after she’s gone. And, if she has children or close friends she cooks for regularly, she may leave a book full of her recipes they all love.
Her legacy then becomes not just about the resources she left behind, but about inspiring future generations to value learning and perseverance, and nourishment. Similarly, your estate plan can be crafted to perpetuate the principles you deem most important, making your influence felt well into the future. 
So now, take a minute to reflect. What principles are most important to you? How do you want to use them to connect your generation to the next?

## Understanding What Legacy Truly Is  

**Legacy**, at its essence, is about forging connections among generations. It transcends material possessions and lives in the principles, memories, and traditions you leave behind. Take, for instance, the story of a teacher who spent her life nurturing curiosity and resilience in her students. While she may not have amassed great wealth, her estate plan could reflect her values by donating her personal library to a local school or establishing a small scholarship fund.  

She might also create a handwritten recipe book for her children and close friends, preserving the meals that brought them together. Here, her legacy becomes a reflection of her love for education, perseverance, and nourishment. Similarly, you can use your estate plan to emphasize the ideals most important to you, ensuring that your presence is felt across generations.

## Estate Planning: A Profound Expression of Love  

Many people mistakenly view estate planning as a dry, legal necessity. In reality, it is one of the most profound ways to show love and care for your family. A thoughtfully designed estate plan is tailored to your specific circumstances and values, ensuring the people you cherish are protected and connected, even in your absence.  

A well-constructed estate plan can also prevent disputes that might otherwise arise among family members. By clearly outlining your wishes, you help preserve harmony and maintain strong familial bonds. Imagine a father who cherished summers spent with his family at a lakeside cabin. Through his estate plan, he ensured this valuable tradition would continue by setting aside funds for the cabin's maintenance and stipulating that it remain within the family.  

This act of foresight not only preserved a beloved tradition but also fostered togetherness and provided future generations with a shared space for creating new memories. Estate planning, when approached with care, becomes a lasting testament to your love and dedication to your family.  

## Practical Steps to Build Your Legacy  

The first step to creating a meaningful legacy is reflecting on your core values and priorities. What matters most to you?
