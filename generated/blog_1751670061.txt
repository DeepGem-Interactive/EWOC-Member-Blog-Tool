# Big Tax Overhaul May Impact Your Finances—Here's What to Know

## Enhanced Incentives for Business Investments

One of the key proposed changes aims to boost business growth by reinstating full "bonus depreciation." Currently, businesses can only deduct 40% of the cost of new assets—such as equipment or vehicles—in the first year. The new legislation, if passed, would allow businesses to write off the entire cost immediately, providing a significant cash flow advantage.

This policy could be especially advantageous for real estate professionals when used alongside cost segregation methods. By breaking out specific property components—such as fixtures, appliances, or flooring—and applying faster depreciation rates, investors could potentially achieve tax savings that outweigh their initial investment. For instance, a $100,000 equipment purchase could result in a full $100,000 tax deduction in the same year, rather than being spread over multiple years.

There’s also good news for businesses involved in research and development. Since 2022, R&D expenses have been amortized over five years. Under the new proposal, these costs could once again be deducted in the year they occur—but only for domestic projects. International R&D expenses would still need to be spread out over 15 years, creating a strong push for U.S.-based innovation.

## Key Benefits for Individual Taxpayers

The proposed legislation brings meaningful changes for individuals, particularly in areas like family support and everyday expenses. The state and local tax (SALT) deduction limit, currently capped at $10,000, would rise to $40,000, giving residents of high-tax states much-needed relief.

Parents could benefit significantly as well. The child tax credit would increase from $2,000 to $2,500 per child, providing a direct reduction in the amount of taxes owed. For larger families, this could translate into thousands of dollars in savings.

The bill also includes other family-friendly provisions, such as eliminating taxes on service industry tips and making overtime pay more appealing. Under the proposed plan, the additional "half-time" portion of overtime pay would be tax-free for workers earning under $200,000 annually. Moreover, lower- and middle-income earners could deduct up to $10,000 in auto loan interest, potentially making car financing more affordable.

## Why Planning Ahead Is Essential

While these changes could open up new opportunities for taxpayers, they come with income thresholds that could phase out benefits for higher earners. To make the most of these provisions, now is the time to strategize. Many of the proposed tax advantages are set to expire by 2028, so acting early could help you maximize your financial outcomes.

Whether you're a business owner, real estate investor, or individual taxpayer, it’s crucial to align your financial plans with these potential changes. Doing so can help you take advantage of the opportunities before they expire.
