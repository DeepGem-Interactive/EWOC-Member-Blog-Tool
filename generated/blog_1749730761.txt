## Understanding Unclaimed Property  

Unclaimed property refers to money or assets that have been forgotten or abandoned over time, often due to a lack of proper documentation or awareness. After a specific period—usually three to five years—these assets are handed over to the state for safekeeping.  

Common types of unclaimed property include:  
- Forgotten savings or checking accounts  
- Uncashed payroll checks or dividends  
- Abandoned stocks, bonds, or brokerage accounts  
- Life insurance payouts  
- Trust distributions and refunds  
- Certificates of deposit and annuities  

The staggering reality is that approximately $60 billion in unclaimed property currently exists across the U.S., according to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators. Shockingly, one in seven Americans has unclaimed assets waiting to be claimed.  

Consider this: if something unexpected happened to you tomorrow, would your loved ones know where to locate all of your assets? Most people aren't entirely sure, and when assets go unnoticed, they often end up as unclaimed property held by the state—just like Dale Benerofe’s $23,000 inheritance from her parents.

## Navigating the Process of Recovering Unclaimed Property  

Finding unclaimed property might seem straightforward, but the process can be time-consuming and frustrating. Here’s what you need to do:  

### Step-by-Step Guide:  
1. **Search in Multiple States**: Check in your current state and any other states where you’ve lived or conducted business.  
2. **Try Variations of Your Name**: Include your middle name, initials, or former names, especially if your name has changed over time.  
3. **File a Claim**: Submit a claim form—usually online—for each state holding your property.  
4. **Provide Documentation**: Gather proof of identity, address history, name changes, and any other documents required to establish your right to the assets.  

Finally, be prepared to wait. Depending on the complexity of your claim and the state’s processes, retrieving your funds could take weeks, months, or even years.

## A Real-Life Example: Dale Benerofe’s Struggle  

Dale’s story is a cautionary tale of how the unclaimed property process can go wrong. After discovering $23,000 in forgotten funds from her deceased parents, she attempted to claim it from the State of Georgia’s Department of Revenue. Despite providing death certificates and other required documents, her request was denied because she couldn’t produce her father’s long-lost driver’s license.  

More than a year later, Dale is still battling to access the money her parents intended for her. Her frustration highlights a critical point: this scenario could have been avoided if her parents had created a comprehensive estate plan.
