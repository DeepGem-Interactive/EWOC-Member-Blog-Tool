# Heads Up! Major Tax Changes on the Horizon  

The passage of new tax legislation by the House has generated significant buzz in both personal and business financial circles. While the bill still awaits Senate approval and a presidential signature, understanding these proposed changes can help you proactively prepare to safeguard your financial future. At MoFahbhjb in Lahorea, our experienced attorney, Moba2, based in Lahorea, lmlkm, can guide you in creating a plan that protects what matters most to you and your loved ones. Let’s explore the key updates in this potential legislation and their implications for individuals and businesses alike.

## Business Asset Purchases May Become More Tax-Friendly  

One of the standout elements of the proposed legislation is the restoration of **100% bonus depreciation**, which could significantly impact business owners and real estate investors. Currently, only 40% of the cost of business assets like equipment or vehicles can be written off in the first year of purchase. If this bill becomes law, businesses will regain the ability to deduct the entire cost of qualifying assets immediately.  

This change is especially advantageous for real estate professionals when paired with cost segregation strategies. By identifying specific components of rental properties—such as lighting, flooring, or appliances—that qualify for accelerated depreciation, investors can unlock immediate tax benefits. For instance:  

- Purchasing a $100,000 piece of equipment would allow you to claim the full deduction in the year of purchase rather than spreading it over several years.  
- Real estate investors could see tax deductions that exceed their upfront cash investment, providing a strategic edge in the property market.  

Additionally, research and development (R&D) expenses would also see favorable adjustments. Businesses could once again deduct domestic R&D costs in the year they occur, reversing the 2022 rule that required spreading them over five years. However, foreign R&D expenses would remain subject to a 15-year amortization period, incentivizing innovation within the U.S.

## Individual Taxpayers May Reap Significant Benefits  

The proposed legislation includes multiple provisions aimed at easing the tax burden on individuals, potentially putting more money in their pockets. For example:  

- **State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction Increase**: Currently capped at $10,000, the SALT deduction would rise to $40,000, benefitting taxpayers in high-tax states.  
- **Child Tax Credit Expansion**: Families would see the credit increase from $2,000 to $2,500 per child, offering direct savings that reduce the tax owed.  
- **Tax-Free Tips and Overtime Pay**: Workers in industries such as food service and beauty would see tips become tax-free, and the overtime pay premium—time-and-a-half—would also be exempt from taxes for most employees.  

Lower and middle-income earners could also benefit from deductions on auto loan interest, with up to $10,000 qualifying under the new rules. These changes collectively present significant opportunities for families to reduce their tax liabilities.

## Strategic Planning is Key to Maximizing Benefits  

While these tax changes could provide valuable opportunities, they require careful planning to ensure eligibility and maximize advantages. Many provisions include income thresholds that phase out benefits as earnings increase. Additionally, most of these tax benefits have expiration dates set for 2028, making it essential to act within the limited timeframe.
