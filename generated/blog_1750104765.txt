So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

For the past couple of weeks, we’ve explored celebrity estate planning and the challenges that come with inadequate preparation for death. This week, we shift focus to a critical yet less-discussed aspect of estate planning: planning for **incapacity**. Incapacity doesn’t affect everyone, but when it does, the consequences can be far-reaching, leading to court battles, financial chaos, and public exposure.  

To highlight the importance of planning for incapacity, we’ll delve into the real-life case of Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. Their experience offers valuable lessons for anyone who values their privacy, family harmony, and financial security. Let’s start by unpacking what incapacity really means—and how the lack of preparation can unravel even the most seemingly stable lives.

## What Does Incapacity Entail?  

Incapacity occurs when someone loses the ability to make clear financial, medical, or legal decisions. This can result from various situations, such as accidents, chronic illnesses, or age-related conditions like Alzheimer’s or dementia. What’s critical to understand is that incapacity strikes while someone is still alive, often leaving loved ones scrambling to sort out financial and legal matters.  

Here’s an essential distinction: incapacity planning and post-death planning are connected but operate under different rules. Documents like **Power of Attorney** might grant authority over someone’s finances during their lifetime but become invalid after death. Without seamless coordination between these plans, loved ones can face delays, additional costs, and legal hurdles.  

For example:  
- **Incapacity planning** ensures someone you trust can manage your financial affairs if you’re unable to.  
- **Post-death planning** transitions control of your assets according to your wishes, avoiding court battles and conflicts.  

Given these complexities, it’s vital to create a strategy that works holistically, ensuring smooth transitions across life’s stages. That brings us back to Jay Leno’s case.
