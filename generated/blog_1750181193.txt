So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

Over the past few weeks, we’ve explored how celebrities have approached—or neglected—planning for their legacies. This week, in the third article of our four-part celebrity series, we shift gears to focus on a topic that is often overlooked: **incapacity**. While the prospect of incapacity is unsettling, it’s an essential consideration as part of your estate and future planning.  

To illustrate why incapacity planning is crucial, we delve into the real-life court case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. The challenges they faced provide valuable insights into the complications that can arise when incapacity strikes unexpectedly—and how advance planning can help avoid these pitfalls.

## What Does Incapacity Mean—and Why Does It Matter?  

Incapacity occurs when an individual loses the ability to make sound decisions regarding their finances, healthcare, or legal matters. This can result from various circumstances, including accidents, severe illnesses, or age-related conditions like dementia or Alzheimer’s. While death is inevitable, incapacity is unpredictable—it can happen at any age and under the most unexpected circumstances.  

What’s particularly important to understand is that incapacity occurs while you’re still alive. Estate planning must account for this unique scenario. Documents like **Powers of Attorney** can provide authority to manage financial or medical decisions during incapacity. However, these documents become void upon death, requiring a separate approach for post-death planning.  

This interplay between incapacity planning and post-death planning highlights the need for a cohesive and comprehensive strategy. Without one, loved ones may face unnecessary legal hurdles and delays, leaving them vulnerable to emotional and financial stress.

## So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)  

Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.  
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist.  

Here are the highlights:  

- **Marital Status Doesn’t Grant Automatic Authority**: Even though Jay and Mavis were married, Jay needed court approval to manage her finances. Similarly, your spouse would need legal authority to oversee your assets if you become incapacitated.  

- **Court Processes Can Be Time-Consuming and Expensive**: Without advance planning, court proceedings to gain control of assets can take months and cost significant money. During this time, bills may go unpaid, or financial institutions may refuse access to accounts.  

- **Conflicts Can Arise**: While Leno’s case was straightforward, family dynamics can complicate court proceedings. For instance, disputes often occur in blended families, where children from previous relationships may challenge a step-parent’s authority.  

- **Public Disclosure of Personal Information**: Court processes require revealing private details, such as family members’ addresses and financial assets. This information becomes public, exposing vulnerable individuals to potential scams—especially older adults.
