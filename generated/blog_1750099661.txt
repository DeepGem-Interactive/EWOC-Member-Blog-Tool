For the last two weeks, we’ve discussed celebrities and how they planned (or didn’t!) for their deaths. In this third installment of our four-part celebrity series, we discuss a topic that no one wants to think about as it may seem to be a fate worse than death: incapacity. Unlike death, not everyone will become incapacitated. Yet, it’s an essential part of your future planning because if you do become incapacitated, you want to have made your choices well before that occurs. To illustrate the importance of planning for incapacity, we’ll examine the real-life court case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. I assure you, it is no laughing matter.

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

Incapacity occurs when someone loses their ability to make sound decisions about financial, medical, or legal matters. This could stem from various causes, such as a traumatic accident, a debilitating illness, or age-related conditions like dementia. It’s essential to recognize that incapacity doesn’t just affect older individuals—it can happen at any stage of life.  

What makes incapacity planning so critical is the suddenness with which it can strike. If you’re unprepared, your loved ones may find themselves navigating a legal and financial mess, which could have been avoided with proactive measures.  

Here’s something many people don’t realize: Incapacity planning differs from post-death planning. For instance, many are familiar with the concept of a Power of Attorney (POA), which grants someone the ability to act on your behalf. However, the authority granted under a POA ends immediately upon your death. This means you need a separate plan for what happens after your passing.  

Incapacity planning and estate planning must work seamlessly together to ensure a smooth transition for your loved ones. Without this coordination, unexpected disruptions can arise, leaving your family in a difficult position. And this is precisely what we learn from Jay and Mavis Leno’s case.

## Lessons from the Leno Case: The Impact of Poor Incapacity Planning  

Mavis Leno, who has been married to Jay for more than four decades, reached a point where her dementia made it impossible for her to manage her financial affairs. Despite their long marriage, Jay had to initiate legal proceedings to gain authority to manage her assets. After months of waiting, the court granted him the rights he needed.  

While this process might seem straightforward, it actually highlights several critical issues:  

- **Marriage doesn’t automatically grant financial authority:** Even as her spouse, Jay did not have the automatic ability to handle Mavis’s financial matters. Similarly, if you’re married, your partner won’t automatically have access to your accounts or assets unless you’ve planned ahead.  
- **Court involvement is unavoidable without prior planning:** Without proper incapacity planning, Jay had to go to court to resolve the matter, a process that took both time and money. During this time, he couldn’t use Mavis’s funds to pay bills or manage her finances.  
- **Public disclosure of private matters:** Court proceedings often require the disclosure of personal information, such as family member details and financial assets. Despite Jay’s celebrity status, this level of exposure wasn’t due to his fame—anyone in a similar situation would face the same issue.  

These points underline why it’s essential to establish a plan that protects your privacy and ensures a seamless transition during periods of incapacity.
