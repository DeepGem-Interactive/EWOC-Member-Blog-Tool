For the last two weeks, we’ve discussed celebrities and how they planned (or didn’t!) for their deaths. In this third installment of our four-part celebrity series, we discuss a topic that no one wants to think about as it may seem to be a fate worse than death: incapacity. Unlike death, not everyone will become incapacitated. Yet, it’s an essential part of your future planning because if you do become incapacitated, you want to have made your choices well before that occurs. To illustrate the importance of planning for incapacity, we’ll examine the real-life court case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. I assure you, it is no laughing matter.

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

Incapacity isn’t something many of us want to dwell on, but its potential impact on your life and your loved ones is impossible to ignore. Losing the ability to make sound decisions—whether financial, medical, or legal—could stem from a tragic accident, a late-stage illness, or conditions like Alzheimer’s. This can happen at any age, and once it does, it’s too late to get your affairs in order.  

One of the most important distinctions to understand is that incapacity occurs while you’re alive. This matters because it means your estate planning must address two separate phases: incapacity and post-death. For instance, a Power of Attorney is a common document used to grant someone authority over your affairs, but many people don’t realize that authority ends immediately upon your death.  

Without proper planning, your loved ones might face unnecessary challenges, including costly court processes and delays. This is why it’s crucial to create a comprehensive plan that ensures a smooth transition through every stage of life.

## Lessons from the Leno Family  

Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis, have been married for over 40 years, but when Mavis was diagnosed with dementia and could no longer manage her financial affairs, Jay had to take legal action to gain control over her finances. This wasn’t due to a lack of love or trust but because, under the law, being married doesn’t automatically grant you authority over your spouse’s separate assets.  

Here are the key takeaways from their case:  

- **Marriage doesn’t equal financial authority**: Even if you’re married, you don’t automatically have access to your spouse’s accounts or assets unless they’ve legally authorized you to do so.  
- **Court involvement is often required**: Without advance planning, a court may need to intervene, which involves time, money, and public disclosure of sensitive family information.  
- **Family dynamics can complicate matters**: If there are blended families or contentious relationships, disputes over control of finances could prolong the process and create unnecessary conflict.  

The Leno family’s experience underscores the importance of having a plan that eliminates the need for court involvement and keeps your private matters out of public records.
