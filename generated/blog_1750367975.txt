So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

In this third chapter of our celebrity estate planning series, we shift focus from planning for death to planning for a scenario many dread even more: incapacity. Incapacity planning is often overlooked, yet it’s an integral piece of securing your future and protecting your loved ones. The story of Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis, demonstrates the very real consequences of not having a detailed plan in place.  

When incapacity strikes, it doesn’t wait for you to sort out your affairs. It can arise suddenly due to an accident, progressive illness, or age-related conditions such as dementia. If you’re unprepared, this can leave your loved ones scrambling to manage your finances, healthcare decisions, and legal matters—all while navigating an emotionally challenging time.  

Let’s dive deeper into what incapacity truly means and why it’s essential to plan for it.

## What Incapacity Means and Why Timing Matters  

Incapacity refers to the loss of ability to make informed decisions regarding your finances, health, or legal matters. It can manifest in various ways—from cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer’s to sudden accidents or life-threatening illnesses. Importantly, incapacity occurs while a person is alive, which adds a layer of complexity to estate planning.  

Here’s something critical to understand: documents designed to address incapacity, such as a Power of Attorney, are effective only while the individual is alive. Once the person passes away, those documents lose their validity, and an entirely different set of arrangements must be in place to manage their estate.  

This distinction highlights the importance of creating a comprehensive plan that bridges incapacity and post-death scenarios seamlessly. Without coordination, loved ones may be forced to navigate legal hurdles that add stress and confusion during already difficult times.  

To illustrate this, let’s look more closely at Jay Leno’s situation and what it reveals about the risks of not planning ahead.

## So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)  

Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.  

That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist.  
Here are the highlights:  
- **Marital status doesn’t grant financial control:** Jay didn’t automatically have the authority to manage Mavis’s finances simply because they were married. Similarly, if your spouse has separate assets, you won’t have access to them without proper planning.  
- **Court intervention is costly and time-consuming:** Without advance planning, a loved one may need to go to court to gain access to your accounts. This process can take months, during which bills may go unpaid or assets could be lost.  
- **Public exposure of private matters:** Legal proceedings often require the disclosure of addresses, family relationships, and financial details. In Leno’s case, this information became public—not because he’s famous, but because the court process mandates such disclosures.  

To avoid these pitfalls, it’s essential to put a plan in place that ensures your wishes are honored and your family avoids the stress of court proceedings.
