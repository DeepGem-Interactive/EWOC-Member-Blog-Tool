For the last two weeks, we’ve discussed celebrities and how they planned (or didn’t!) for their deaths. In this third installment of our four-part celebrity series, we discuss a topic that no one wants to think about as it may seem to be a fate worse than death: incapacity. Unlike death, not everyone will become incapacitated. Yet, it’s an essential part of your future planning because if you do become incapacitated, you want to have made your choices well before that occurs. To illustrate the importance of planning for incapacity, we’ll examine the real-life court case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. I assure you, it is no laughing matter.

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

Incapacity, though a difficult subject, is a reality that can impact anyone at any stage of life. It refers to losing the ability to make sound financial, medical, or legal decisions for yourself. This could stem from a variety of situations, such as a sudden accident, a progressive illness like dementia, or even age-related conditions like Alzheimer’s. The critical takeaway is this: incapacity occurs while you are alive, and without prior planning, it may leave your loved ones in a chaotic situation.  

Many assume that estate planning is solely about preparing for death, but it also involves creating safeguards for situations where you may no longer be able to act in your best interest. For example, a widely misunderstood document, the Power of Attorney (POA), grants someone authority over your financial affairs but only while you are alive. Once you pass away, that authority ends, and a separate legal authority is needed to handle remaining matters.  

This is where the importance of a cohesive plan comes into play—one that addresses both incapacity and post-death transitions. Without such a plan, even a spouse or close family member may have to go through court proceedings to gain control of your assets or make decisions on your behalf, as evidenced by the case of Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis.

### The Leno Case: What Happened and Why It’s a Cautionary Tale  

Jay Leno’s story offers a sobering example of what can occur when incapacity strikes without proper planning. Mavis Leno, his wife of over 40 years, has been battling dementia and has reached a stage where she is unable to manage her financial affairs. Despite their long marriage, Jay had no automatic authority to handle her finances. He had to file a lawsuit—essentially suing his own wife—to obtain court approval to take control of her accounts.  

Here are some important lessons from the Leno case:  

- **Marriage Does Not Grant Automatic Financial Authority**  
Even if you are married, you do not automatically have access to your spouse’s separate assets. Without prior arrangements, such as a comprehensive plan, one spouse may be forced to go to court for authority over the other’s financial matters.  

- **The Court Process Is Time-Consuming and Public**  
The legal process to gain control of an incapacitated loved one’s finances can take months, during which bills may go unpaid, or you may have to cover expenses out of your own pocket. Additionally, court proceedings are public, making personal and financial details accessible to anyone, including potential scammers.  

- **Family Dynamics Can Complicate Matters**  
Although Jay and Mavis appear to have had no familial conflict, imagine if stepchildren or other relatives had contested Jay’s request. Disputes like these can drag out the court process, increase costs, and create unnecessary tension within the family.  

The Leno family’s situation underscores the importance of having a proactive, private plan in place that avoids court involvement and protects your family from unnecessary stress.

### Why Incapacity Planning Is More Crucial Than Ever  

With an aging population and rising cases of dementia, incapacity planning has never been more relevant. According to Alzheimer’s Disease International, more than 55 million people globally live with dementia, a number projected to grow to 78 million by 2030. But incapacity isn’t limited to aging-related issues—it could stem from an accident or a sudden illness at any age.  

At MoF in Lahore, we understand that life is unpredictable. That’s why we work with you to develop a comprehensive approach to safeguarding your future. Our Life & Legacy Planning ensures you and your family are prepared for whatever life brings, with minimal disruption and maximum peace of mind.
