For the last two weeks, we’ve discussed celebrities and how they planned (or didn’t!) for their deaths. In this third installment of our four-part celebrity series, we discuss a topic that no one wants to think about as it may seem to be a fate worse than death: incapacity. Unlike death, not everyone will become incapacitated. Yet, it’s an essential part of your future planning because if you do become incapacitated, you want to have made your choices well before that occurs. To illustrate the importance of planning for incapacity, we’ll examine the real-life court case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. I assure you, it is no laughing matter.  

## What Is Incapacity and Why Should You Plan for It?  

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

It’s important to remember that incapacity happens while you’re still alive. This is an essential distinction, as estate planning involves preparing for various stages of life, from incapacity to post-death transitions. Many people are familiar with a document called a **Power of Attorney**, which grants authority for someone to manage another’s affairs. However, a little-known fact is that this authority ceases upon death. That means while you may have access to a loved one’s finances during incapacity, managing their estate after death will require separate legal authority, often involving a court process unless a trust is in place.  

To avoid unnecessary complications, it’s critical to establish a plan that addresses both incapacity and post-death matters. A well-coordinated approach ensures that your loved ones can navigate these transitions without unnecessary stress or legal hurdles.  

## Lessons from the Leno Family: What Happened and Why It Matters  

In the case of Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis, the absence of advance incapacity planning led to significant legal complications. Mavis, who has been battling dementia, reached a point where she could no longer manage her finances. Jay was forced to go to court to gain legal authority to handle her financial affairs—a process that took months to resolve.  

This situation underscores some critical lessons:  

- **Marriage doesn’t grant automatic authority over finances.** Even as a spouse, you do not have an automatic right to manage your partner’s separate accounts or assets. Without prior arrangements, you may need to pursue legal action to gain access.  
- **The court process is costly and time-consuming.** Jay Leno had to file a lawsuit against his wife’s estate to gain control. This is the default process in most jurisdictions when incapacity planning hasn’t been established, and it can take months while bills go unpaid or assets remain inaccessible.  
- **Public exposure of personal details.** Court proceedings often require disclosure of private family and financial information, making these details accessible to the public. This not only compromises privacy but can also make vulnerable individuals a target for scams.  

Had Jay and Mavis created a comprehensive plan in advance, they could have avoided these challenges. For those of us in Lahore or elsewhere, the lesson is clear: proper planning isn’t just for the wealthy or famous; it’s for anyone who wants to protect their loved ones from unnecessary hardship.
