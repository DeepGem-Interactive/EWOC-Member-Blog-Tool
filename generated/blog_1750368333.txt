In this installment of our celebrity estate planning series, we’re shifting focus to an often overlooked but critical aspect of planning—incapacity. While death is inevitable, incapacity presents a unique set of challenges that can arise unexpectedly. To underscore this point, we’ll dive deeper into the real-life case of Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis, exploring what their experience teaches us about preparing for the unforeseen. If you’ve ever wondered what incapacity planning entails and why it matters, this article will provide insights that can help safeguard your family’s future.

## Understanding Incapacity: A Vital Aspect of Estate Planning

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

One crucial distinction to grasp is that incapacity planning and estate planning must work hand in hand. While incapacity planning addresses your needs during life, estate planning focuses on what happens after death. For example, a Power of Attorney grants someone authority to manage your affairs while you're alive but ceases to be effective upon your death. Without additional planning instruments like trusts, your loved ones could face delays and costly court proceedings to manage your estate.

**Key points to remember about incapacity:**
- Incapacity can occur at any age, making it necessary to plan ahead.
- Powers of Attorney only apply while the grantor is alive; they don’t cover post-death transitions.
- Coordinated incapacity and estate planning ensure a seamless transition for your loved ones.

By addressing incapacity now, you can spare your family from unnecessary stress and court involvement later. Let’s look at how Jay Leno’s family situation brings these lessons to life.

## The Jay Leno Case: A Real-Life Illustration of Incapacity Challenges

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)  
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.  
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist.  

### Lessons from the Leno Family's Ordeal

Jay’s case highlights several critical issues many families face when incapacity planning is neglected:

1. **Marriage Doesn’t Grant Automatic Financial Authority:**  
   Despite being married for decades, Jay lacked the legal authority to manage Mavis’s assets. This underscores the fact that marital status doesn’t automatically provide access to a spouse’s individual accounts or property. Without proper planning, a spouse might have to go to court to gain control over finances, as Jay did.

2. **The Cost of Court Proceedings:**  
   Filing a lawsuit to manage a loved one’s assets takes time and money. In Jay’s situation, months passed before he could access Mavis’s accounts to pay bills. Not every family has the financial resources to cover expenses in the interim, leaving assets vulnerable to mismanagement or outright loss.

3. **Family Dynamics and Potential Conflicts:**  
   The Lenos avoided disputes in court, but not all families are so fortunate. Previous marriages, stepchildren, and inheritance concerns can create friction, which prolongs the legal process and drives up costs.

4. **Public Disclosure Risks:**  
   Court proceedings often require families to disclose personal information, including financial details and addresses. This can make them targets for scams, particularly if they are older or vulnerable.

Without advance planning, these challenges can compound, leading to stress, conflict, and financial loss for families. Thankfully, there are ways to avoid such pitfalls.
