## Introduction  

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

From this case, we’ll uncover essential insights, including:  
- What incapacity truly entails  
- The limitations spouses face when handling one another’s financial affairs  
- How court involvement can expose your private matters  

Let’s start by understanding what incapacity actually means and why it’s so vital to plan ahead.  

## What Is Incapacity—and What It’s Not  

Incapacity refers to the inability to make sound decisions regarding your finances, medical care, or legal matters. It can occur due to a variety of reasons: a sudden accident, a debilitating illness, or age-related conditions like dementia or Alzheimer’s. Unlike death, incapacity doesn’t have an age limit—it can happen at any time. That’s why planning ahead is crucial, as once incapacity occurs, it’s too late for you to make the necessary arrangements, leaving your loved ones to navigate a difficult and messy situation.  

**Key points to keep in mind:**  
- Incapacity occurs while you’re alive, not after death.  
- Estate planning requires separate arrangements for incapacity and for post-death handling.  

For many, the concept of a Power of Attorney is familiar. However, it’s often misunderstood. A Power of Attorney grants authority during the grantor’s lifetime, but this authority ceases upon their death. If a loved one passes away, any access you had to their financial accounts under a Power of Attorney will terminate. You’ll require new authority—usually from a court—to manage their remaining assets.  

This highlights why your incapacity plan and your post-death plan must work hand-in-hand. Together, they ensure a seamless transition that minimizes stress for your loved ones. As the Leno case shows, failure to plan for incapacity can lead to unnecessary court involvement, delays, and public exposure of private matters.
