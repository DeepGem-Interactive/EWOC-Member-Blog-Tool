For the last two weeks, we’ve discussed celebrities and how they planned (or didn’t!) for their deaths. In this third installment of our four-part celebrity series, we discuss a topic that no one wants to think about as it may seem to be a fate worse than death: incapacity. Unlike death, not everyone will become incapacitated. Yet, it’s an essential part of your future planning because if you do become incapacitated, you want to have made your choices well before that occurs. To illustrate the importance of planning for incapacity, we’ll examine the real-life court case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. I assure you, it is no laughing matter.  

The Leno family’s legal battle offers a crucial lesson on what happens when a loved one becomes incapacitated without proper planning. From their case, we can glean insights into key aspects of incapacity, including:  
1. What incapacity entails and its implications.  
2. The limitations of spousal authority over financial matters.  
3. How lack of preparation can drag families into court and expose private affairs.  

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

## What Exactly Is Incapacity?  

When a person is incapacitated, they lose the ability to make rational financial, medical, or legal decisions. In some cases, they may become entirely unable to communicate their wishes. Incapacity can arise due to various reasons, such as:  
- Sudden accidents resulting in severe injuries.  
- Chronic illnesses like dementia or Alzheimer’s.  
- Age-related cognitive decline.  

It’s important to note that incapacity happens while a person is still alive, and this distinction matters greatly in planning. Many people believe that estate planning only pertains to what happens after death. However, incapacity planning ensures that if something happens to you while you’re alive, your financial and personal affairs won’t be left in disarray.  

Consider this: Many people rely on a document known as a **Power of Attorney** (POA). While this document is essential for enabling someone to manage your affairs if you’re incapacitated, its authority ends the moment you pass away. Once you die, a completely separate plan must take over to manage your remaining assets.  

By ensuring that your incapacity and post-death plans work in harmony, you can provide seamless transitions and minimize hardships for your family. This brings us to the lessons learned from the Leno family.  

## Lessons from the Leno Case  

Jay Leno’s legal troubles underscore the risks of insufficient incapacity planning, even for married couples. Mavis Leno, Jay’s wife for over 40 years, was diagnosed with dementia and eventually lost the ability to manage her own finances. Despite their decades-long marriage, Jay had no automatic right to handle her financial affairs. To do so, he had to file a lawsuit against his wife’s estate and wait for the court’s decision.  

Here are some critical takeaways from their situation:  

- **Marriage Doesn’t Automatically Grant Financial Authority**  
   Even if you’re married, you don’t have automatic rights to your spouse’s separate assets. Each person’s accounts and properties are legally their own unless specific legal documents, like trusts or joint accounts, are in place. Without these arrangements, a spouse may have to sue to gain control over shared responsibilities.  

- **The Court Process is Expensive and Time-Consuming**  
   Jay Leno had to wait several months and spend significant money in legal fees before obtaining the court’s permission to manage Mavis’s assets. During this time, he likely faced challenges paying her bills or managing finances tied to her accounts. This delay could have been avoided with proper planning.  

- **Family Dynamics Can Worsen the Situation**  
   While Jay and Mavis’s long-lasting marriage may have simplified the court process, many families are not so fortunate. In blended families or those with contentious relationships, disputes over financial control can lead to drawn-out legal battles. These conflicts make the court process even more expensive and emotionally taxing.  

- **Public Exposure of Private Matters**  
   Because Jay had to go to court, his family’s personal and financial details became part of the public record—not because he’s a celebrity, but because the law requires such disclosures. This lack of privacy leaves families vulnerable to scams and unwanted attention.  

From these lessons, it’s clear that relying on default legal processes can lead to unnecessary complications. However, there’s a better way to safeguard your loved ones and your legacy.  

## A Life & Legacy Plan: The Key to Avoiding Court and Conflict  

A **Life & Legacy Plan** offers a far more effective way to manage your affairs in the event of incapacity. Unlike traditional approaches, this type of plan ensures a smooth transition of responsibilities, avoiding delays, court involvement, and unnecessary stress for your family.
