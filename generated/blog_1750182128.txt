So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

For the past couple of weeks, we’ve explored how some celebrities planned—or failed to plan—for their passing. This week, however, we’re shifting gears to discuss an equally crucial yet often overlooked aspect of estate planning: **incapacity**. Unlike death, incapacity doesn’t affect everyone, but when it does, the consequences can be significant if no prior arrangements are in place.  

To highlight the importance of planning for incapacity, we’re examining the real-life case of Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. Their situation underscores the challenges that arise when incapacity strikes and no comprehensive plan is in place. The lessons from their experience reveal critical insights about:  
1. What incapacity entails.  
2. The limitations spouses face when dealing with each other’s financial affairs.  
3. How a lack of planning can lead to court involvement and public disclosure of personal information.  

Let’s delve into these topics, starting with understanding what incapacity really means.

## What Incapacity Means and Why It Matters  

Incapacity refers to losing the ability to make clear financial, medical, or legal decisions—or even to communicate effectively. This can occur due to various factors, such as:  
- A debilitating accident.  
- Chronic illnesses like Alzheimer’s or dementia.  
- Age-related cognitive decline.  

Unlike death, incapacity happens while you’re alive, and that distinction is critical when it comes to estate planning. Timing is everything, and your incapacity plan must work seamlessly with your post-death arrangements to ensure smooth transitions for your loved ones.  

**The Role of Powers of Attorney**  
Many people rely on Powers of Attorney for incapacity planning, but few realize these documents lose their validity upon the grantor’s death. This means while you may be able to manage someone’s finances during their lifetime, you’ll need separate authority—often from the court—to handle their estate after passing.  

For example, if assets aren’t held in a trust, your loved ones may face legal hurdles to access them after your death. To avoid this, your incapacity and post-death plans must complement each other, creating a unified strategy that minimizes stress and conflict for your family.

## So, What Happened in the Leno Family?  

Mavis Leno, Jay’s wife of over 40 years, was diagnosed with dementia and reached a point where she could no longer manage her financial matters. This left Jay in the difficult position of having to go to court to gain authority over her finances—a process that involved filing a lawsuit against his own wife.  

After months of legal proceedings, the court granted Jay the authority he needed, but the situation raises several important points:  
- **Marriage Doesn’t Grant Automatic Authority:** Even though they were married, Jay couldn’t access Mavis’s accounts without court approval. Similarly, if you’re married, your spouse won’t automatically have control over your separate assets.  
- **Court Processes Are Time-Consuming and Costly:** Without advance planning, someone will need to go to court to gain authority over your finances if you become incapacitated—whether you have a Power of Attorney or not. This can take months, during which bills may go unpaid or assets could be lost.  
- **Conflict Can Slow Things Down:** In Jay and Mavis’s case, no one challenged Jay’s request, but if there had been disputes—for example, from children of a previous marriage—the court process could have dragged on even longer, increasing costs and risks.  
- **Public Disclosure of Personal Information:** Court proceedings require revealing personal and financial details, making them accessible to the public. This privacy breach can expose vulnerable individuals to scams, especially older adults.  

The Leno family’s ordeal could have been avoided with proper incapacity planning. The good news? You can take steps today to ensure your family won’t face similar challenges.
