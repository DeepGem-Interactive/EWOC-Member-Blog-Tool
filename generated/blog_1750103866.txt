For the past two weeks, we’ve explored how celebrities prepared (or failed to prepare) for their passing. Now, in the third chapter of our four-part celebrity series, we’re shifting the focus to an issue many shy away from—incapacity. While not everyone will face this challenge, planning for it is just as critical as preparing for death. With the example of Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis, we’ll uncover why incapacity planning is vital and how neglecting it can lead to costly consequences.  

The real-life situation involving the Leno family serves as a cautionary tale, shedding light on what happens when incapacity strikes and advance planning is absent. From this case, we’ll uncover essential lessons:  
1. Understanding what incapacity truly means.  
2. Recognizing the limits of a spouse’s authority over financial matters.  
3. Realizing how court involvement can expose private family details.  

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

## Understanding Incapacity: What It Is and Why It Matters  

Incapacity refers to losing the ability to make sound decisions—whether financial, medical, or legal—on your own. This can happen due to various reasons, such as a severe accident, a degenerative illness like dementia, or age-related conditions like Alzheimer’s. Unfortunately, incapacity can strike unexpectedly, regardless of age or health. When it does, it’s often too late to ensure your affairs are in order, leaving your loved ones to deal with the fallout.  

Here’s a critical distinction: incapacity occurs while you’re alive. That may sound obvious, but it matters because estate planning is deeply tied to timing. Certain documents, such as Powers of Attorney, can be employed to manage your affairs during incapacity. However, these documents lose validity upon your death, necessitating a separate plan to handle post-death matters.  

Why does this distinction matter? Because many people assume a Power of Attorney provides a seamless solution. While it does grant authority to act for a loved one during their life, that authority ends immediately upon their passing. If assets aren’t held in a trust, court intervention is required to manage remaining assets.  

This highlights why incapacity planning and post-death planning must complement each other. Together, they ensure a smooth transition for your loved ones, sparing them unnecessary stress and delays. And this brings us to Jay Leno’s case.  

## Jay Leno’s Family Case: A Wake-Up Call for Planning  

Mavis Leno, Jay’s wife of over four decades, suffers from dementia and can no longer manage her financial affairs. Despite their long-standing marriage, Jay wasn’t automatically entitled to handle her finances. Instead, he had to file a lawsuit against his own wife to gain authority over her accounts—a process that took months before the court granted him the necessary control.  

This case underscores several significant points:  

- **Marriage doesn’t automatically grant financial control:** Even if you’re married, your spouse doesn’t have automatic access to your separate accounts or assets. Without advance planning, they may need to go to court to gain authority—a process that can be both time-consuming and expensive.  
- **Court involvement comes with delays and costs:** Jay had to endure months of waiting and incur legal expenses to resolve the matter. During this time, bills might remain unpaid, and financial institutions may not offer leniency.  
- **Conflicts can prolong the process:** Although Jay and Mavis’s case wasn’t contested, imagine if there were children from a previous marriage or other relatives disputing the authority. Such conflicts often lead to drawn-out cases, increasing costs and risks to the assets in question.  

Moreover, the court process exposed private details about the Leno family—information that became public not because of their celebrity status, but because court proceedings often require disclosure of addresses, family members, and asset details. This makes families vulnerable to scams, which disproportionately target older individuals.  

The good news? There’s a better way to handle such situations. A proactive approach can prevent the pitfalls faced by the Leno family.
