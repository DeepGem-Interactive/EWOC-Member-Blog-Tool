So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

While many of us focus on planning for what happens after we’re gone, fewer people recognize the importance of preparing for incapacity—a situation where you’re alive but unable to make critical decisions about your finances, healthcare, or legal matters. If you don’t address this possibility, your family could face painful delays and public court battles, as illustrated by the recent case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis.  

This blog dives deeper into the key lessons from Leno’s experience, offering practical insights to help you avoid similar challenges. Whether you’re in Lahorea, PK, or anywhere else, the need for proactive planning affects us all.

## What Exactly Is Incapacity?  

Incapacity occurs when a person loses the ability to make sound decisions regarding their personal and financial affairs, whether due to an accident, illness, or age-related conditions like dementia. While it’s impossible to predict if or when incapacity might strike, it’s crucial to understand that this state creates complex challenges that must be addressed while you’re still capable.  

**Key points about incapacity:**  
- Incapacity is a condition that arises while you’re alive, unlike death, which marks the end of legal and financial decision-making.  
- Estate planning documents like Powers of Attorney only apply during your lifetime and become void upon death, requiring entirely new legal arrangements for post-death matters.  
- Without a robust plan for incapacity, loved ones are left scrambling to navigate legal hurdles in court, often at great financial and emotional cost.  

For instance, imagine relying on your spouse to manage your finances if you become incapacitated. Without a proactive plan, they may not automatically have the authority to access certain accounts or property. This is where the Leno case provides a stark cautionary tale.
