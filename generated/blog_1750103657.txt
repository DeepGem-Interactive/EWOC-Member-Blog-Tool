For the last two weeks, we’ve discussed celebrities and how they planned (or didn’t!) for their deaths. In this third installment of our four-part celebrity series, we discuss a topic that no one wants to think about as it may seem to be a fate worse than death: incapacity. Unlike death, not everyone will become incapacitated. Yet, it’s an essential part of your future planning because if you do become incapacitated, you want to have made your choices well before that occurs. To illustrate the importance of planning for incapacity, we’ll examine the real-life court case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. I assure you, it is no laughing matter.

## What Exactly Does Incapacity Entail?

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

It’s important to note that incapacity happens while you’re still alive. This is critical because estate planning needs to address two separate phases: your life (including incapacity) and your eventual passing. Without a clear plan for both, your loved ones may face unnecessary legal and financial challenges during an already difficult time.

Take, for instance, the common document known as a Power of Attorney. Many believe this document gives them unlimited authority to manage someone else’s affairs. However, powers granted under a Power of Attorney end upon the grantor’s death. This means your incapacity planning documents won’t cover post-death matters, and your estate’s affairs must then be managed under separate legal authority. To avoid complications, it’s essential to ensure your incapacity and post-death plans work hand-in-hand for a smooth transition.

Now, let’s dive into the Leno family’s experience and the lessons it holds for all of us.

## A Closer Look at the Leno Case

Jay and Mavis Leno, married for over four decades, faced a challenging situation when Mavis developed dementia and could no longer manage her financial affairs. To gain control of her finances, Jay was forced to initiate legal proceedings, essentially suing his own wife. After a lengthy court process, Jay was granted the authority he needed.

This scenario underscores several key points:
- **Marriage doesn’t guarantee financial authority**: Even as a spouse, Jay didn’t automatically have the right to manage Mavis’s accounts. The same applies to anyone—marital status doesn’t grant you control over your partner’s assets without prior legal arrangements.
- **Court involvement is costly and time-consuming**: Without incapacity planning, navigating the court system for financial authority takes months and incurs significant legal fees. Meanwhile, bills may go unpaid, or loved ones might have to dip into their own savings to cover expenses.
- **Public exposure is unavoidable**: Court proceedings require detailed disclosures about family members, addresses, and financial holdings. This information becomes part of the public record, making families vulnerable to scammers and privacy breaches.
- **Conflict potential is high**: While the Lenos likely avoided disputes due to their long-standing marriage, blended families or unresolved tensions could lead to prolonged conflicts, higher costs, and delayed resolutions.

The Lenos’ experience highlights why advance planning is so crucial. Without it, even celebrities with substantial resources can find themselves entangled in avoidable legal battles.

## How a Life & Legacy Plan Can Prevent These Issues

- **Immediate access to assets**: There’s no waiting for court approval; funds remain accessible when they’re needed most.
- **Privacy protection**: Your personal and financial details stay confidential, shielding your family from unwanted exposure and potential scams.
- **Conflict avoidance**: By clearly outlining your wishes, you minimize the likelihood of disputes among loved ones.
