# Heads Up! Major Tax Changes on the Horizon  

The House has recently approved groundbreaking tax legislation that could significantly transform the financial landscape for both individuals and businesses. While the bill still awaits Senate approval and the President's signature, understanding the proposed changes now can offer a strategic advantage, helping you plan ahead and maximize potential benefits.  

At MoFahbhjb, located in Lahorea, we specialize in helping clients like you navigate complex financial and legal shifts. With expert guidance from Lawyer Moba2, based in Lahorea, lmlkm, you can create a plan that protects what matters most and ensures your loved ones are cared for. Let’s explore the most important elements of this proposed legislation and discuss how it might affect you.  

## Potential Business Benefits: More Flexibility and Immediate Deductions  

One of the most impactful changes for businesses centers on **bonus depreciation**. Under current regulations, businesses can only write off 40% of the cost of most new equipment or vehicles during the first year of purchase. The proposed legislation seeks to restore the ability to write off **100% of the cost immediately**, which could significantly improve cash flow for business owners.  

This shift is particularly advantageous for real estate investors and companies that rely on equipment purchases. For instance:  
- A business purchasing a $100,000 piece of equipment would be able to deduct the full amount in the year of purchase instead of spreading the deduction across several years.  
- **Cost segregation strategies** could amplify benefits for real estate professionals by allowing them to depreciate components like lighting, flooring, and appliances faster than the building itself.  

In addition, research and development expenses would be treated more favorably. Since 2022, businesses have been required to amortize R&D costs over five years. If passed, the legislation will allow immediate deductions for domestic R&D, incentivizing innovation within the United States. However, foreign R&D would still be subject to a 15-year amortization period, offering clear incentives for companies to keep operations stateside.  

These provisions create opportunities for businesses to grow while minimizing tax burdens. At MoFahbhjb in Lahorea, we can help you develop a comprehensive approach to make the most of these changes and safeguard your business's future.  

## Individual Taxpayer Relief: More Money in Your Pocket  

The proposed legislation also includes measures that would directly benefit individual taxpayers, offering relief in key areas that impact daily life. For example:  
- **State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction**: The current deduction cap of $10,000 would increase to $40,000, which is especially beneficial for individuals in high-tax states.  
- **Child Tax Credit**: Families could see the child tax credit rise from $2,000 to $2,500 per child, a direct dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability that could result in thousands of dollars in savings for larger families.  
- **Tax-Free Tips and Overtime Pay**: Workers in industries like food service and beauty would no longer pay taxes on tips, while overtime pay would see the “extra half” portion of time-and-a-half become tax-free for employees earning less than $200,000 annually.  

Additional benefits include deductions for auto loan interest up to $10,000 for lower and middle-income earners. Taken as a whole, these measures are designed to ease financial strain for individuals and families.  

However, many of these benefits come with income thresholds that phase out as earnings rise. Strategic planning is crucial to ensure you can qualify for these deductions and credits. With Lawyer Moba2’s expertise and commitment to keeping your loved ones out of court and out of conflict, MoFahbhjb in Lahorea can help you create a plan that ensures lasting peace of mind while taking advantage of these changes.  

## Act Now: Strategic Planning for a Limited Window  

While these proposed tax benefits are promising, they come with an expiration date—most are set to expire in 2028. To make the most of this limited window, individuals and businesses alike must act now to position income and assets strategically.
