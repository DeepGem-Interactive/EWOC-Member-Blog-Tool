For the last two weeks, we’ve discussed celebrities and how they planned (or didn’t!) for their deaths. In this third installment of our four-part celebrity series, we discuss a topic that no one wants to think about as it may seem to be a fate worse than death: incapacity. Unlike death, not everyone will become incapacitated. Yet, it’s an essential part of your future planning because if you do become incapacitated, you want to have made your choices well before that occurs. To illustrate the importance of planning for incapacity, we’ll examine the real-life court case involving Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis. I assure you, it is no laughing matter.

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

When we talk about **incapacity**, we’re referring to the inability to make sound decisions regarding financial, medical, or legal matters. This could result from aging-related conditions like dementia or Alzheimer’s, a severe illness, or even an unexpected accident. It’s a reality that can affect anyone at any stage of life, and once it happens, it’s too late to set up proper safeguards. Without these measures in place, families are left navigating a complicated and often overwhelming situation.

It’s critical to note that incapacity occurs while you’re still alive, which differentiates it from death in the realm of estate planning. This distinction is vital because the documents and plans set up for incapacity become invalid upon death, requiring a separate set of post-death arrangements. **Planning ahead ensures a seamless transition**, avoiding unnecessary financial and emotional stress for your loved ones.

One commonly misunderstood tool in this context is the Power of Attorney (POA). While a POA can grant authority to manage someone’s affairs during their lifetime, this authority ceases immediately upon their death. If no additional planning exists, loved ones may need to go through the court system to gain control of remaining assets. This gap highlights the importance of coordinating both incapacity and post-death planning to ensure your family’s needs are met without unnecessary legal hurdles.

## The Leno Family’s Court Battle & Its Lessons

Jay Leno’s situation offers a stark reminder of what can happen when incapacity strikes without sufficient planning. After Mavis Leno, his wife of over 40 years, became unable to manage her financial affairs due to dementia, Jay was forced to take legal action to gain control of her accounts. It involved filing a lawsuit—essentially against his own wife—and waiting for the court to grant him the necessary authority.

This case underscores several critical lessons:

- **Marriage doesn’t automatically grant financial authority:** Even as spouses, assets or accounts in one person’s name remain solely theirs. Without prior arrangements, a spouse may need to go to court to gain access to these assets.
- **The court process is time-consuming and costly:** Jay’s case took months to resolve, during which bills and financial obligations likely hung in limbo. Such delays can create significant financial strain, particularly for families without immediate access to cash.
- **Court proceedings make private matters public:** Details about Jay and Mavis Leno’s finances and personal lives became accessible to the public—not because of their celebrity status, but because court records are generally public. This lack of privacy can expose families to scams or other vulnerabilities.
- **Conflict complicates everything:** While the Lenos’ long-standing marriage likely minimized disputes, blended families or estranged relatives often add layers of contention, extending and complicating the legal process.

These outcomes are not unique to celebrities—they could happen to anyone. However, they are entirely preventable with the right planning.

Incapacity planning has never been more critical, especially with the rising prevalence of dementia and other conditions related to aging.
