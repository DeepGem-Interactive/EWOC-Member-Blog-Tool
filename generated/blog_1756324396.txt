# Heads Up! Major Tax Changes on the Horizon  

The House recently approved sweeping tax legislation that could significantly alter the financial landscape for both individuals and businesses. While the bill still requires Senate approval and the President’s signature to become law, understanding its potential impact now could help you plan ahead and seize new opportunities. At MoFahbhjb, located in Lahorea, lead attorney Moba2 is here to guide individuals and business owners in Lahorea, lmlkm through these proposed changes and help create a plan that grows with your loved ones and ensures lasting peace of mind.  

In this article, we’ll cover some of the most notable provisions of the proposed legislation, touching on changes that impact business owners, individual taxpayers, and families.  

## Business Tax Advantages Are Set to Expand  

The proposed bill introduces favorable tax changes for businesses, particularly when it comes to asset purchases and research and development (R&D).  

### Enhanced Bonus Depreciation for Business Assets  

One of the most impactful provisions reinstates **100% bonus depreciation** for business assets. Currently, businesses are limited to writing off only 40% of the cost of items like equipment or vehicles in the first year of purchase. With the proposed change, businesses could deduct the full cost of these purchases immediately, providing significant upfront tax savings.  

- For example, if you purchase a $100,000 piece of equipment, instead of spreading deductions over several years, you could claim the entire $100,000 in the year of purchase.  
- Real estate professionals stand to benefit even more when this change is combined with cost segregation strategies, allowing faster depreciation for property components like flooring and appliances.  

### Greater Flexibility for R&D Expenses  

Another key change involves research and development costs. Since 2022, businesses have been required to amortize these expenses over five years, limiting their immediate financial benefits. The new legislation proposes a return to allowing domestic R&D costs to be fully deductible in the year incurred. However, foreign R&D expenses would still be amortized over 15 years, incentivizing innovation within the United States.  

These provisions offer exciting opportunities, but they also require precise planning to maximize benefits. MoFahbhjb in Lahorea can help you create a plan that protects what matters most to your business and ensures your strategies align with these new tax rules.  

## Individual Taxpayers May See Financial Relief  

For individuals, the bill includes several provisions designed to ease tax burdens and increase disposable income.  

### Higher SALT Deduction Limits  

Residents of high-tax states will appreciate the proposed increase in the **state and local tax (SALT) deduction** cap, which would rise from $10,000 to $40,000. This adjustment could provide substantial relief for taxpayers who have been limited by the current cap.  

### Expanded Child Tax Credit  

The **child tax credit** would increase from $2,000 to $2,500 per child. This dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability could translate into thousands of dollars in savings for families with multiple children.  

### Tax-Free Tips and Overtime Pay  

The bill proposes eliminating taxes on tips for workers in industries such as food service and beauty. Additionally, overtime pay would become more appealing, as the "extra half" of time-and-a-half wages would be tax-free for workers earning under $200,000 annually.  

### Deductible Auto Loan Interest  

Another individual benefit includes up to $10,000 in deductible auto loan interest for lower- and middle-income earners. These provisions could help families reduce their tax bills and redirect savings toward other priorities.

## Prepare Now to Maximize Opportunities  

While many of these changes offer significant advantages, they come with income thresholds that phase out benefits for higher earners. Additionally, most provisions are set to expire in 2028, making it crucial to act within this limited window.  

Strategic planning is essential to ensure you’re positioned to qualify for these credits and deductions. Whether you’re a business owner or an individual taxpayer, MoFahbhjb in Lahorea can assist you in putting a plan in place that honors your wishes, protects your loved ones, and grows alongside your evolving needs.  

### Key Takeaways:

- **Individuals:** Higher SALT deductions, expanded child tax credits, tax-free tips/overtime pay, and deductible auto loan interest.  
- **Action Required:** Income thresholds and expiration dates require proactive planning to maximize benefits.
