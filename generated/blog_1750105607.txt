So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

The case illustrates three key points: what incapacity truly entails, the limitations of spousal authority in managing finances, and the risks of having private family matters exposed in court. By understanding these lessons, you can take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones, ensuring your wishes are honored even if life takes an unexpected turn.  

## What Does Incapacity Really Mean?  

**Incapacity** occurs when someone can no longer make rational decisions regarding their finances, medical care, or legal matters. This can stem from various situations, such as a sudden accident, a severe illness, or age-related conditions like dementia or Alzheimer’s. While it might seem similar to death in its implications, incapacity is unique in that it happens during life—and often unexpectedly.  

Importantly, incapacity highlights the timing issue in estate planning. Documents such as Powers of Attorney are invaluable tools for managing affairs during life but are ineffective after death. Conversely, post-death planning tools like wills and trusts are useless during incapacity. This means your **incapacity plan** and **post-death plan** must work hand-in-hand to ensure a smooth transition and avoid legal headaches for your family.  

The reality is stark: If you don’t plan for incapacity, your loved ones may face months of court battles, delays, and expenses to manage your affairs. Let’s turn to Jay Leno’s story for a real-world example of what can go wrong.

## The Consequences of Inadequate Planning  

Jay Leno's case highlights several issues:  

1. **Marriage Doesn’t Grant Automatic Authority:** Contrary to popular belief, being married does not give you the automatic right to manage your spouse’s finances. Without proper planning, spouses must navigate complex court systems to gain authority over separate assets.  

2. **Court Proceedings Are Costly and Time-Consuming:** The legal process to obtain financial control can take months and drain resources. During this time, bills may go unpaid, or you may need to cover expenses out-of-pocket without immediate reimbursement.  

3. **Family Conflicts Can Arise:** Legal battles often open the door to disputes, especially in blended families. Stepchildren or other heirs may challenge financial decisions, prolonging court cases and increasing costs.  

4. **Public Exposure of Private Matters:** The court process requires revealing personal details, such as family relationships, addresses, and financial information. This makes vulnerable individuals a target for scammers—a risk amplified for older adults.
