# Big Tax Shifts Ahead: What You Need to Know

## Enhanced Benefits for Business Investments

A significant portion of the proposed tax legislation focuses on making business purchases more advantageous. Under the current system, businesses can only deduct 40% of the cost of qualifying assets—like machinery, vehicles, or other equipment—in the first year. The new proposal aims to reinstate full 100% bonus depreciation, allowing businesses to write off the **entire expense upfront**.

For instance, if your business invests in a $100,000 piece of equipment, you’d no longer need to spread the deduction over several years. Instead, the full amount could be deducted in the purchase year, offering an immediate boost to cash flow.

For real estate professionals, this is a game-changer when paired with cost segregation techniques. This strategy allows you to allocate parts of a property—like appliances, lighting, or flooring—to shorter depreciation schedules. The reintroduction of 100% bonus depreciation could result in substantial tax savings that may even exceed the initial cash outlay.

Additionally, the legislation proposes restoring the ability to immediately deduct research and development (R&D) expenses for domestic projects. Since 2022, companies have been required to spread these deductions over five years. However, under the new proposal, only domestic R&D would qualify for immediate deductions, while foreign R&D costs would continue to be amortized over 15 years—encouraging innovation to remain within the U.S.

## What’s in Store for Individual Taxpayers?

For individual taxpayers, the proposed changes aim to deliver relief in several key areas. One of the most noteworthy adjustments is the increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. Currently limited to $10,000, the proposed increase to $40,000 would provide substantial relief to residents of high-tax states who’ve been unable to deduct a significant portion of their state and local taxes.

Parents also stand to benefit, with the child tax credit increasing from $2,000 to $2,500 per child. Unlike a mere deduction, this credit directly reduces your tax liability, potentially leading to thousands in savings for families with multiple children.

Other proposed changes include eliminating federal income taxes on tips for workers in the food service and beauty industries. Additionally, the extra “half” of time-and-a-half overtime pay would become tax-exempt for non-highly compensated employees—those earning under $200,000 annually.

Even auto loans are addressed in the proposal, with up to $10,000 in interest payments on car loans becoming deductible for middle and lower-income earners. Collectively, these provisions could significantly ease the financial burden on working families.

## Strategic Tax Planning Is Essential

While these changes offer numerous opportunities, they also introduce complexities that require careful planning. Many of the benefits are subject to income thresholds, meaning that your eligibility could phase out as your earnings increase. By planning proactively, you can structure your finances to maximize these tax breaks.

It’s also important to note that most of these proposed benefits are temporary, set to expire in 2028 unless extended. This gives you a limited window to capitalize on these changes.
