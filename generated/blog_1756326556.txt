# Major Tax Reform: How Upcoming Changes Could Impact You and Your Loved Ones  

The House recently passed a sweeping tax reform bill that could bring significant shifts to the financial landscape for individuals and businesses alike. While this legislation still needs Senate approval and the President’s signature to become law, understanding what’s proposed now can provide valuable insight into preparing for potential opportunities. At MoFahbhjb in Lahorea, our team, led by Moba2, is here to help you create a plan that protects what matters most during these transformative changes.  

## Key Changes for Businesses: Enhanced Opportunities for Growth  

The proposed tax reforms include provisions that could notably benefit business owners and investors. One of the standout changes centers on **bonus depreciation**. Under current law, businesses can only deduct 40% of the cost of certain assets, such as equipment or vehicles, in the first year of purchase. The new legislation would restore **100% bonus depreciation**, allowing businesses to write off the entire cost immediately.  

This adjustment is particularly advantageous for real estate investors and business owners who frequently acquire equipment or property. For instance:  

- If you purchase a $100,000 piece of machinery, you could deduct the full amount in the year of purchase, rather than spreading the deduction across several years.  
- Real estate professionals could combine this benefit with **cost segregation strategies**, identifying components of rental properties—like lighting, flooring, or appliances—that can be depreciated faster than the building itself.  

Additionally, businesses conducting **research and development (R&D)** would regain the ability to immediately deduct domestic R&D expenses. Since 2022, these costs have been spread over five years, creating financial challenges for innovators. Although foreign R&D would still need to be amortized over 15 years, this provision incentivizes keeping innovation within the U.S.  

## Individual Taxpayer Benefits: More Money in Your Pocket  

For individuals, the proposed legislation includes measures aimed at easing financial burdens. For residents in high-tax states, the cap on the **state and local tax (SALT) deduction** would increase from $10,000 to $40,000, offering much-needed relief.  

Parents would also see significant benefits with an increase in the **child tax credit**, rising from $2,000 to $2,500 per child. Unlike a traditional deduction, this credit reduces your tax bill dollar-for-dollar, potentially saving families thousands annually.  

The legislation further proposes tax relief for specific industries and income groups:  

- **Workers in food service and beauty industries** could enjoy tax-free tips.  
- **Overtime pay** would become partially tax-exempt, with the "extra half" of time-and-a-half pay excluded from taxes for most workers earning below $200,000.  
- For lower and middle-income earners, up to $10,000 in **auto loan interest** could be deductible, providing relief for those financing vehicle purchases.  

Together, these provisions could help many families reduce their tax liabilities, freeing up resources to focus on their loved ones’ needs.  

## Strategic Planning Is Essential  

While these changes create potential opportunities, they also introduce complexities requiring careful planning. Many benefits include **income thresholds**, phasing out relief as earnings rise. Acting now to strategically position your finances can help ensure eligibility for these valuable deductions and credits.  

It’s also important to note that most of these tax benefits are set to expire in 2028, meaning there’s a limited window to capitalize on these opportunities. Working with MoFahbhjb in Lahorea, led by Moba2, offers you the chance to develop a comprehensive approach to safeguarding your family’s future during this pivotal time.  

### How You Can Prepare  

Consider these strategic steps:  

- Evaluate your current income and expenses to understand how thresholds may impact your eligibility.  
- For business owners, explore asset purchases or R&D investments that align with the proposed changes.  
- Families should assess how new deductions, credits, and exclusions could fit into their financial plans.
