## Why Incapacity Planning Matters More Than You Think  

In Lahorea, MoFa is dedicated to helping families prepare for life’s uncertainties with lasting peace of mind. Lawyer Moba, based in Lahorea, PK, knows firsthand how crucial planning ahead can be for families, particularly when dealing with incapacity. This week, as part of our four-part celebrity estate planning series, we pivot from discussing celebrity deaths to a topic many avoid—incapacity. Jay Leno’s real-life court case provides a stark reminder that without proper planning, families can face unnecessary legal battles and public exposure during already challenging times.  

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

Let’s begin by understanding what incapacity is and why it’s so critical to plan for it.  

## What Is Incapacity and Why Should You Care?  

Incapacity occurs when someone can no longer make sound decisions regarding their finances, medical care, or legal matters. It can happen at any age due to circumstances like accidents, serious illnesses, or conditions linked to aging, such as dementia or Alzheimer’s. When incapacity strikes, it’s too late to prepare, leaving loved ones in a difficult position to manage your affairs without proper legal authority.  

Here’s an important distinction: incapacity happens while you’re alive, whereas most estate planning documents focus on what happens after death. A well-rounded plan needs to address both scenarios seamlessly.  

Take, for example, a Power of Attorney (POA). Many people mistakenly believe a POA grants lifelong authority. However, its power ends immediately upon the grantor’s death. This means that while a POA can help manage finances during incapacity, a completely separate plan is needed for post-death transitions.  

Without a cohesive strategy tying incapacity and post-death planning together, families can face unnecessary delays, expenses, and stress. The Leno case is a prime example of why this matters.  

## Lessons From Jay Leno’s Case: What Happened and How It Impacts You  

Jay Leno, the iconic comedian and former host of “The Tonight Show,” recently faced a harsh reality when his wife of over 40 years, Mavis, became incapacitated due to dementia. Unable to access her accounts or manage her financial affairs, Jay had no choice but to file a lawsuit against his own wife to gain legal authority.  

Although the court eventually granted Jay the authority he needed, the ordeal highlights key lessons for anyone navigating incapacity planning:  

### Key Takeaways From The Leno Case  

1. **Marriage Doesn’t Grant Automatic Financial Authority**  
   Even though Jay and Mavis had been married for decades, Jay could not manage her separate assets without court intervention. Similarly, if you’re married, your spouse doesn’t automatically gain control of your accounts or property. Advance planning is essential to avoid court battles.  

2. **Court Involvement Is Time-Consuming and Costly**  
   Jay’s experience underscores how court processes can delay access to critical financial resources. Bills may go unpaid, or loved ones may have to cover expenses out-of-pocket while waiting for legal approval.  

3. **Conflict Can Prolong Court Cases**  
   While the Lenos avoided major disputes, imagine if Mavis had children from a prior marriage who contested Jay’s request for control. In such cases, prolonged litigation can deplete assets and intensify family tensions.  

4. **Public Exposure of Personal Affairs**  
   The Leno family’s story became public not because of Jay’s celebrity status but because court proceedings require disclosure of personal and financial information. This exposure can make vulnerable individuals susceptible to scams or unwanted attention.  

These lessons serve as a wake-up call. Without proper planning, incapacity can lead to court battles, public scrutiny, and unnecessary financial strain. Thankfully, there’s a better solution.  

## The Solution: Life & Legacy Planning
