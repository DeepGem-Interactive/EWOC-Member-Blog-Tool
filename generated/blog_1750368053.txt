## The Hidden World of Unclaimed Property

What the Process Looks Like
Finding out if you have unclaimed property can be an arduous process. Even though you can search online, you’ll go through many steps before (or if) you can receive your money. Here’s what the process looks like:
Step 1—Check multiple states. Conduct a search in your current state of residence and any other states where you've lived, worked, or conducted business. 
Step 2 - Search variations of your name. Try different spellings and include your middle name or initial to ensure a thorough search. If your name has changed over the years, you must also check your former names. Again, search all variations of your name in states where you’ve lived, worked, or conducted business.
Step 3 - File a claim. If you find property owed to you, you must file a claim form (usually online) with the state holding your assets. You’ll need to file a form in every state where your assets are held; there is no one-form-to-rule-them-all.
Step 4 - Gather documentation to prove your identity and the identity of your loved one(s). Be prepared to provide documentation to prove your identity and your right to the property. This may include proof of address (at any address you’ve lived), proof of name change, or proof of marriage or divorce. You’ll need to provide similar documentation for your loved ones if you have a claim to their property.
Finally, be patient. Depending on the state and the complexity of your claim, the claim process can take weeks, months, or even years.

**Unclaimed property** refers to financial assets that have been left inactive for a specific period, often between three to five years. When these assets remain untouched, they are legally transferred to the state for safekeeping. Common types of unclaimed property include:  

- Forgotten bank accounts  
- Uncashed payroll or dividend checks  
- Abandoned investment accounts  
- Unclaimed life insurance payouts  
- Unused refunds or trust distributions  

Shockingly, it’s estimated that between $50 billion and $70 billion in unclaimed property exists in the United States. A staggering one in seven Americans is owed some of this money, according to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators.  

Take a moment to think: if something were to happen to you, would your family know where to find all your assets? For many, the unfortunate answer is no. Without a clear plan in place, these assets can easily slip through the cracks, leaving your loved ones to deal with unnecessary stress and financial loss.  

## How to Search for Unclaimed Property  

Finding unclaimed property isn’t as straightforward as you might hope. The process involves several steps, often requiring significant patience and persistence.

## A Real-Life Example: The Cost of Not Planning  

Dale Benerofe’s story offers a cautionary example of how unclaimed property can become a nightmare without proper planning. After discovering $23,000 owed to her parents, she filed a claim with the Georgia Department of Revenue in May 2023. Despite providing death certificates and other required documentation, her claim was denied because she could not produce her father’s driver’s license, a document long gone.  

As of today, more than a year later, Ms. Benerofe is still fighting for the money that should rightfully be hers, describing the process as exhausting and disheartening. Her story underscores the importance of ensuring your loved ones can easily access your assets when the time comes.
