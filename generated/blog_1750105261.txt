So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist. 
Here are the highlights:
Even though they were married, Jay did not have automatic authority to manage Mavis’s finances. And neither will you if you’re married and your spouse has separate assets. Any assets or accounts you own are your property and your property alone. Marital status is irrelevant. And, if you don’t have advance planning in place, your spouse could need to go to court and sue your “estate” to get appointed and be able to take control of your assets. 
Leno had to file a lawsuit (against his wife) to gain control of his wife’s finances. That’s the process, no matter what State you’re in. If you don’t have advance planning and you become incapacitated, someone will need to go to court to get authority, even if you have powers of attorney in place. And it will cost time (a few months in most cases) and money. While waiting for the court to rule, you won’t be able to pay your spouse’s bills using their money (or they may spend away, unaware of what they’re doing). That leaves you with two options: 
You can pay the bills with your money and then get reimbursed later. This may be fine, especially if you have the financial means. But if you don’t have immediate access to cash, say your spouse paid all the bills from their account, this could mean trouble and potential loss of the asset. Or, bills simply go unpaid. Maybe you can explain the situation to the financial institution, and they will be patient while the court process plays out, but this doesn’t always happen. 
The court process is set up for conflict, and the more conflict there is, the longer the process will take. In Leno’s case, he and Mavis have been married for over 40 years, and it’s their first and only marriage (relationship goals, right?). Given this fact, it’s reasonable to assume that no one challenged Jay’s request. But what if one of them had been married before and had children from the prior marriage? And what if one of those children wanted to ensure they got their inheritance and didn’t want the step-parent to have any control over the money? Sadly, this happens all the time. When it does, the case can go on and on, meaning court costs go up, and the assets in question could be at risk due to the time delay. 
Leno’s personal and family information became public knowledge, but not because he’s famous. In most States, you must disclose your address, your family members and their addresses, and information about the financial assets. The Leno family's story is available for all of us to read, not because he’s famous, but because they had to go to court. 
This can be problematic because scammers are paying attention. They tend to pay particular attention if you (or someone you love) are vulnerable, especially if you’re older. I could write books about how often older people fall prey to these scams. And they’re all terribly disturbing.
So, what have you gleaned from these insights so far? If anything concerns you, know there is a much better way this could have been handled. And this better way lies within your reach. 

This article will cover:  
- What incapacity means and how it differs from death  
- The legal limitations spouses face in managing each other's finances  
- How the absence of preparation can make private family matters public  

Let’s start by understanding the concept of incapacity and its implications.  

## Understanding Incapacity: What It Is and Why It Matters  

Incapacity refers to the inability to make sound legal, medical, or financial decisions for yourself due to a physical or mental condition. Whether it’s the result of a sudden accident, a degenerative illness like Alzheimer’s, or age-related decline, incapacity can leave families grappling with difficult decisions. Unlike death, incapacity occurs while you’re still alive, and failing to plan ahead can create a tangled mess for your loved ones.  

It’s important to note that incapacity planning is distinct from post-death arrangements. For instance, powers granted under a Power of Attorney document only apply while the individual granting them is alive. These powers end immediately upon death, requiring a separate plan to handle assets after that.  

Here’s why having a proactive strategy matters:  
- **Smooth transitions:** Incapacity planning ensures that your loved ones can manage your affairs without interruption.  
- **Legal clarity:** It eliminates the confusion around what family members can and cannot do without legal authority.  
- **Avoiding court battles:** Without proper planning, your family could find themselves in expensive and time-consuming court proceedings to gain access to your assets.  

Now let’s examine how these principles played out in the Leno family’s story.  

## The Jay Leno Case: A Wake-Up Call for Incapacity Planning  

So, What Happened In the Leno Family? (And What It Means for You)  
Mavis Leno, Jay's wife of more than 40 years, is battling dementia and has reached the point where she can no longer handle her financial affairs. So, Jay had to go to court (essentially filing a lawsuit against his own wife) to be able to manage her finances. After a few months, the court ruled and gave Jay the authority he requested.  
That’s essentially the entire story. But we can’t stop there! Even from just three simple sentences above, several key takeaways exist.  

### Key Lessons from the Leno Case  

1. **Marriage doesn’t grant financial control:** Even though Jay and Mavis were married, Jay didn’t automatically have the authority to manage her separate financial assets. Spouses must go through legal processes to gain control over accounts or property without pre-planning.  
2. **Court challenges are unavoidable:** Without advance planning, even loving families are forced to navigate the legal system. This can lead to delays, costs, and emotional stress.  
3. **Public exposure:** The Leno family’s personal details—including addresses and financial information—became public knowledge not because of fame but due to the requirements of court proceedings. This risk applies to any family, making them potential targets for scammers.  

### Potential Consequences of No Planning  

- **Unpaid bills:** If one spouse manages finances but becomes incapacitated, the other may struggle to access funds to cover expenses.  
- **Family disputes:** In blended families, stepchildren or other relatives may contest financial decisions, prolonging court battles and increasing costs.  
- **Vulnerability to fraud:** Public court records can expose personal details, making elderly individuals prime targets for scams.  

The Leno case underscores why advanced incapacity planning is vital for families of all backgrounds. Let’s look at how a Life & Legacy Plan can provide a solution.
